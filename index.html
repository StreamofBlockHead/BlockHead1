							<h2>My first project: Turret Mayhem</h2>
							<p>In this Unity game project, I focused on making the player feel more alive instead of just moving around like a sliding object. I created a walking animation that plays whenever the player moves, which makes the character’s movement feel more realistic and smooth. Setting this up helped me understand how player input, movement scripts, and animation controllers all work together in Unity.</p>
							<p>There are also turrets that the player needs to avoid. These turrets shoot red laser beams, creating obstacles that force the player to think carefully. If the player gets hit by a laser, they are sent back to the starting point.</p>
							<p>Working on this project taught me a lot about game design basics, such as collision detection, triggering animations, and creating simple enemy behavior. Overall, this project helped me improve both my technical skills in Unity and my understanding of how to make gameplay more engaging and fun.</p>

							<h2>Birdhouse Designing on TinkerCad and Real Construction with Wood</h2>
							<p>In this project, I designed a birdhouse using Tinkercad to plan its shape and dimensions before building it. Creating the digital model helped me visualize how the pieces would fit together and allowed me to make changes easily.</p>
							<p>After finishing the design, I built the birdhouse using real wood planks and nails. I carefully measured and assembled the pieces to make sure the structure was stable and properly put together.</p>
							<p>Working on this project taught me how digital designs can be turned into real-life objects. It also helped me understand the importance of planning, accuracy, and hands-on building skills.</p>

							<h2>Unity project: Exploding Bomb</h2>
							<p>In this Unity project, I worked on creating a bomb object that visually changes when it explodes. The bomb starts in its normal form and then switches to an exploded version, making the explosion feel clear and noticeable to the player.</p>
							<p>I also created a particle effect that plays when the bomb explodes. The particles spread out in a semicircle shape, which helped make the explosion look more dynamic and directional.</p>
							<p>Working on this project helped me learn how to swap objects, trigger visual effects, and use Unity’s particle system. Overall, it improved my understanding of how animations and effects can make gameplay feel more impactful and polished.</p>
